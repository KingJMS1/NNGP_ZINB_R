\arguments{
\item{X}{Other Predictor variables}

\item{y}{Zero inflated count response}

\item{coords}{Spatial coordinates for NNGP}

\item{Vs}{Spatially varying predictor variables (e.g. one-hot indication of which location this is for varying intercept), wrapped in sparseMatrix from Matrix R package. Will be multiplied by the spatial random effects for prediction.}

\item{Vt}{Temporal varying predictor variables, wrapped in sparseMatrix from Matrix R package. Will be multiplied by the temporal random effects for prediction.}

\item{Ds}{Spatial distance matrix, diagonal should be 0, off diagonal is distance between elements i and j in space, inputs to the spatial NNGP kernel}

\item{Dt}{Temporal distance matirx, diagonal should be 0, off diagonal is distance between elements i and j in time, inputs to the temporal GP kernel}

\item{M}{How many neighbors to allow in the spatial NNGP algorithm, defaults to 10.}

\item{nsim}{How long to run MCMC in total, must be greater than burn.}

\item{burn}{How long to run MCMC before saving samples.}

\item{thin}{How often to save MCMC samples, default is 1, saves every iteration.}

\item{save_ypred}{Whether or not to output the predicted values at every iteration}

\item{print_iter}{How often to print the iteration number of the MCMC chain.}

\item{print_progress}{Whether or not to print the iteration number of the MCMC chain.}
